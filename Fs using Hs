First i have written an verilog code for full substractor in xilinx vivado......

Next i run RTL Analysis and gated structure which is our digital circuit.....

Now i wrote test bench for test the circuit for functional verification.....

After writing the test bech code -> Run Behavioral simulation and we will get a wave tab.....

The whole process is very crucial specially in rtl code writing . In there we use Two Half Substractor for Full Substractor. 
I just wrote a RTL structure for half substractor and use it two times in another module...thank you
